# python-programming-assignment-
week1
Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.
Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.


ANSWERS:
# Simple calculator program

# Ask the user for the first number
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Ask the user for the second number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Ask the user for the operation
operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

# Perform the calculation based on the operation
if operation == '+':
    result = num1 + num2
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == '-':
    result = num1 - num2
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == '*':
    result = num1 * num2
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == '/':
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
        print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {result}")
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
else:
    print("Invalid operation. Please enter +, -, *, or /.")
